## Program to calculate area of a Triangle

length = int(input("Enter the length of a triangle (in cm) : "))
breadth  = int(input("Enter the breadth of a triangle (in cm) : "))
Area = 1/2* length * breadth

print(f'The Area of triangle with (length : {length} cm and breadth : {breadth} cm) is : {Area} squared cm')
